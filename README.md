# Python Learning Project

This repository is a personal project dedicated to learning Python programming. It serves as a space for me to practice and experiment with Python code while documenting my progress.

## Getting Started

If you're new to Python or want to follow along with my learning journey, feel free to explore the code and documentation within this repository.

## Learning Resources

I'll be using various learning resources such as online tutorials, books, and courses to enhance my Python skills. Here are some of the resources I'm using:

- [Python Official Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/): The official Python documentation is a great resource for understanding the language's features and libraries.

- [Python.org](https://www.python.org/): The official Python website has a wealth of information and links to tutorials and resources.

## Progress

I'll periodically update this repository with code examples, small projects, and notes related to my Python learning journey. You can check the commit history and project files to see my progress.

## Contributions

While this repository is primarily for personal learning, I welcome contributions, suggestions, and feedback from the Python community. Feel free to open issues or pull requests if you have any ideas or improvements to share.

## License

This project is open-source and available under the [MIT License](LICENSE).

Happy coding and learning! üêçüöÄ
